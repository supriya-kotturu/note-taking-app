# Fixed Version Information

This configuration uses:
- Next.js 14.0.4
- @clerk/nextjs 4.29.1 (Last known stable version for Next.js 14)
- Standard auth import from @clerk/nextjs

To apply these changes:

1. Delete the `.next` folder and node_modules:
```bash
rm -rf .next node_modules
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The auth function should now work correctly with this configuration.
