To fix the "table `public.Note` does not exist" error, you need to run Prisma migrations to create the database tables. Follow these steps:

1. First, create the initial migration:
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

2. This command will:
   - Create the migration files
   - Apply the migration to your database
   - Generate the Prisma Client

3. If you want to verify the tables were created, you can use Prisma Studio:
```bash
npx prisma studio
```

The error occurs because while you have defined the schema in `schema.prisma`, the actual database tables haven't been created yet. The migration command will create all necessary tables based on your schema definitions.
