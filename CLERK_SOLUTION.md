# Clerk Integration Solution

To resolve the Client Component error with Clerk, the following changes have been made:

1. Updated `@clerk/nextjs` to version 4.29.1 in package.json
2. Replaced the custom `navigate` function with `routing="path"` in ClerkProvider
3. Simplified the routing configuration in layout.tsx

## Additional Steps Required

After applying these changes:

1. Run `npm install` to update the dependencies
2. Clear the `.next` cache with `npm run clean`
3. Restart the development server with `npm run dev`

The error should now be resolved as we're using:
- Latest stable Clerk version (4.29.1)
- Latest stable Next.js version (14.0.4)
- Path-based routing instead of custom navigation

The configuration in layout.tsx is now using the recommended approach for Next.js 14 with the latest Clerk SDK.
