# Solution: "auth is not a function" Error Fix

## The Problem
The error `(0 , _clerk_nextjs__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__.auth) is not a function` occurs due to compatibility issues between certain versions of Clerk and Next.js 14, particularly when using the `auth()` function.

## The Solution
We've fixed this by:

1. Using `currentUser()` instead of `auth()`:
```typescript
import { currentUser } from "@clerk/nextjs";

export default async function Home() {
  const user = await currentUser();
  const userId = user?.id;
  // ... rest of the code
}
```

2. Setting the correct Clerk version:
```json
"@clerk/nextjs": "4.27.5"
```

3. Using Next.js 14.0.4:
```json
"next": "14.0.4"
```

## Why This Works
- `currentUser()` is more reliable in Next.js 14 server components
- Version 4.27.5 of Clerk has better compatibility with Next.js 14
- This approach avoids webpack bundling issues that can occur with `auth()`

## Steps to Apply the Fix
1. Clear your Next.js cache:
```bash
rm -rf .next
```

2. Remove node_modules:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Additional Notes
- Make sure your environment variables are correctly set in `.env`
- The middleware configuration has been updated to properly handle public routes
- Server components are now properly configured to use Clerk's authentication

If you still experience issues after applying these changes, make sure to:
1. Check that your Clerk credentials are valid
2. Verify you're using Node.js 18.17 or later
3. Clear your browser cache
4. Ensure no conflicting Clerk instances are running
